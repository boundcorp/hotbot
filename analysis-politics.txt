My biggest complaint since Kamala was anointed as candidate has been the relative lack of policy specifics.    Today it occurred to me, that possible reason is that if they rolled out specific policy too quickly it would counter the notion that her place on the ticket was an unexpected surprise.  So the Kamala campaign continues to be short on specifics.

The occupiers call such property "ownerless".   About two thousand apartments belonging to Ukrainian citizens, who were forced to leave the occupied territory since the beginning of the first phase of Russian aggression, have been recorded among the real estate.   In addition, "discovered" property on the occupied territory of Ukraine can also be transferred to "federal" or "regional" ownership."   As a result, the occupiers use the looted property to achieve their goals, in particular, to resettle enemy personnel and their families, relatives, etc.

The U.S. led the way with 669 devices removed to combat digital asset fraud. In Europe, 59 crypto ATMs were shut down. In August, German police, supported by Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin, dismantled 13 unlicensed ATMs.   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Supreme Court introduced a daily withdrawal limit of $1,000 to reduce crypto fraud risks.

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill on Friday that would have made some undocumented immigrants eligible for up to $150,000 in state-backed home loans, rejecting a proposal that ignited criticism from the right as immigration has become a major tension point in the election.  The Democratic governor’s veto comes a day after former President Donald Trump said he would ban undocumented immigrants from receiving home mortgages if he returns to the White House. Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, described the California bill last month as “fundamentally unfair but typical Democrat policy.”  https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/newsom-california-undocumented-immigrants-homes-00177748

On the other hand, it seems just as likely to be remembered as a clumsy attempt to influence millions of nonvoters while creating fresh controversies.

Well, it is what it is, we need new leaders on the Left, and we especially need ones that aren't going to cave in to the establishment and sell us all out like Bernie and his team did. I worked my ass off for both of his campaigns and what I learned is that it's impossible to change the Dem Party, it's rigged to the core by the ruling class and they'll never give it up. We have to build something to replace it, a party that's not corrupted. That's why I'm Green Party for life now. Bernie and the Squad was the last straw for me. Forget his pitiful ask in this ad for donations to a warmonger, I am once again asking you - will you join me in building the Green Party, and continuing the political revolution?

Grew up having to listen to Rush Limbaugh in the mornings, Ronald Reagan should have been eligible for a third term, and Clinton should get impeached 30 times over.   I have always found his lifelong Republicaness funny to me (any extreme position is) and material for fodder.  I remember a few years back, I asked my mom if my dad has made out to the Republican primaries to put check off the Donald Trump box.  I was SHOCKED at what my mom told me next, "Your father is now a registered Democrat and voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries."  WHAT!!!!

We often agitate for that freedom but many do not understand the freedom of speech is a responsibility, a responsibility not just for you but to others. In as much as we as individuals want to be respected for our opinions, its more important for us to respect that of others.  Words are sacred and powerful, as we are clamoring for free speech, we should also understand that human rights are not just entitlements, they are responsibilities.
